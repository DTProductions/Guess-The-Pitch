# Guess The Pitch

Pitch recognition trainer for those who wish to improve pitch awareness and memory.

# Description

Upon starting the game, a sound is played, and the user has to press a key on the virtual piano that he thinks corresponds to the sound, after which a screen tells whether the answer was right or wrong (and the correct answer).

The game may be used for practicing both pitch memory and interval recognition, whereby once a note has been identified, it can be employed as a reference point for subsequent notes.

The pitches range from A3 to C6.
